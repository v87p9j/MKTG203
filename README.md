1 APA Study Café is a new concept designed to cater specifically to university students and has been open for one month. This café is strategically located on Symonds Street near several universities, providing both a quiet and stimulating environment for students to study, collaborate, and relax. The café is open every day from 6am to 1am. The café aims to be more than just a place to grab coffee; it’s a hub for academic and social interaction. It spans four levels, with food and beverages served on the first level. Managed by Nia, the first-level café operates with two shifts of staff, each working 9.5 hours daily. The team consists of two baristas, two chefs, and two servers to manage the café which seats up to 60 customers. The first shift works from 6 am to 3:30 pm, while the second shift takes over from 3:30 pm to 1 am. Barista Tom is known for his friendly demeanour and expert coffee-making skills. He takes the time to remember regular customers' names and their favourite orders, creating a personalised experience. On the other hand, Nia has received some complaints about Barista Sam for frequently getting customers' orders wrong, causing frustration and delays. In addition, there are mixed reviews from customers about his coffees, but they enjoy his recommendations for food and beverage. APA Study Café sources its ingredients from local farmers and suppliers ensuring freshness and supporting the community. The menu features a blend of classic and innovative items, such as the cafes signature lavender latte and avocado toast with a twist.
The study spaces in the café are located on the three floors above and operate on a membership only basis with a booking system. A separate team of four staff members is responsible for managing the study spaces which have designated quiet zones with soundproof booths for students who need a quiet space to concentrate on their studies. It also has open seating arrangements with whiteboards and screens for both individual study and group study sessions and team meetings. Recently, Nia has noticed that working professionals aged 25 to 50 frequently visit the café, not only for food and beverages but they have also purchased memberships for the study spaces. Although the café has only been open for a month, Nia wants to expand its services by adding a laundromat and dry-cleaning service in the available space on the first floor to cater to their busy customers.Explain to Nia the four unique characteristics of services and discuss one challenge and one solution for each characteristic that she could implement in managing her café.
Additionally, advise Nia on two promotional mix elements she should use in a promotional campaign for the new laundromat and dry-cleaning service aimed at her customers. Finally, explain whether you would recommend including an AI influencer in the promotional campaign and why or why not.
